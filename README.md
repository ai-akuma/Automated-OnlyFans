## Description

OnlySnarf is a python based automation tool to assist with uploading content to OnlyFans by interacting with the site via web scraping. OnlySnarf carries no weapons, but it has been known to use its tail, teeth and claws when improperly configured.

Here are some debugging previews of how it looks when everything works:

- [Discount](//ipfs.io/ipfs/QmboqfpCeAAbbhqGhPQ8cCscqm7CNH4mxTPR42g8Cg7iLW?filename=discount.gif)
- [Message](//ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXitqxkRuMXb6XnUJw7MHUxLii7UNEXjENc5k4PyfTWfY?filename=message.gif)
- [Poll](//ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNkE4GpBoiQ3tGLLfxtTGS96jJJJixS4qbkx9fxN9GeYC?filename=poll.gif)
- [Post](//ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUBjuLK3yh5v4U9SSPmSG3NAGgYaY6rYoYACGi1smZpJ7?filename=post.gif)
- [Schedule](//ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUd843FXXyMP2eyfkB1d1erZyrKN1hmKchuviruzN8ctD?filename=schedule.gif)
- [Users](//ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmc9zPytgSKx4EK6V1A8DABNeCpMxBybcRs4hNtAMSKDyi?filename=users.gif)

## Config

### Update the default configuration classes prior to installation. These will be generated into an egg bundle when running `python setup.py install` and will be used as the default config for all users.

Update:

- default.py
- config.conf

Example config files are provided. There are two main config files that should be provided to affect runtime behavior as well as one optional method to help distinguish between user logins.

1. the config for the general app's behavior: `$HOME/.onlysnarf/config.conf`
2. one config for each user containing their credentials: `$HOME/.onlysnarf/users/$username.conf`
3. (optional) one config containing the default user credentials to use: `$HOME/.onlysnarf/users/default.conf`

For example: `$HOME/.onlysnarf/users/alexdicksdown.conf`

## Installation

pip: `python -m pip install onlysnarf`  
clone repo & install: `git clone git@github.com:skeetzo/onlysnarf && python setup.py install`

> usage: snarf [-h] [-version] ...
>
> positional arguments:
> input file or folder path for input to post or message
>
> optional arguments:
> -h, --help show this help message and exit
> -version show program's version number and exit
> -[refer to [menu](public/docs/menu.md) for more options] ...

> Shnarrf!

Example: `snarf -text "suck my giant balls" /path/to/balls.jpeg`

**No**, the user credentials _are not_ handled in the safest manner because they are very clearly stored in plain text and without any encryption. Yes, a better way can be figured out. Do I think a better way is necessary for this project? No. So please be careful with your own credentials.

## Dependencies
